# How to do it?
First, off your going to need bepinex 6.0 for ill2cpp, Crab Game is an ill2cpp game meaning its much more annoying to mod and stuff is obfuscated.

Download BEPINEX 6.0 Preview Here:
https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be

Once You Have Downloaded it extract it and put Bepinex, Mono, doorstop.ini and winhttp.dll into Crab Games root folder.
You can find the root folder by going to steam, and right clicking on crab game then manage and click Browse local files.

Now run crab game, then close it, if you open the Bepinex folder you should see a folder called 'Unhollowed' that means that its successfully decompiled the game.

Now your going to need **Visual Studio**, in visual studio your going to create a new **Dynamic Link Dll using .NET**
